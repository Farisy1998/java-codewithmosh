Strategies tp create a thread safe code. Also known as solutions
for concurrency issues.
Thread Safe Code means a code that can be safely executed across 
multiple threads.

1. Confinement - To confine or restrict each thread have its 
                 own data.
2. Immutability - To share immutable objects accross multiple 
                  threads.
                  So the data stored in the original object won't change.
3. Syncronization - Restricting multiple threads to access a
                    resource concurrently. We do this by using
                    locks on critical sections of a program. 
                    But the syncronization is not a perfect solution.
                    Becuz this will lead to a dead lock state 
                    some time.
4. Volatile Keyword - it solves the visibility problem of threads. 
                    But it doesn't solve the race condition. Means if
                    one thread changes the data other thread can able to 
                    see the change.
5. Atomic objects - By using atomic classes in java.
                    Means the JVM won't break the operation on this atomic objects in to different steps instead this will  done in a single step.
6. Partitoning - Partitoning data in to segments that can be
                 access concurrently.
